# Payload-PC104 #

This repository contains schematics and footprints of the PC104 standard for CubeSats' payloads. 
These designs are compatible with Eagle and KiCad PCB design software.
The footprints have also a suggested PCB boundary that facilitates the cable management of the CubeSat.

# KiCAD #

The KiCAD's schematic includes all the necessary pins assignments to speedup the payload design. The footprint already has the edge cuts done and it follows the PC104 specification.

This design had as a base the work of [spel-uchile's work](https://github.com/spel-uchile/Payload-PC104) and expands upon it
